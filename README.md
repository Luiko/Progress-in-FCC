##What is [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about)?
It's an [open source community](https://github.com/freecodecamp) that helps you learn to code.

##What is it this project?

##What kind of work going to publish?
For me the most relevant to see, its algorithms scripting challenges and projects.
